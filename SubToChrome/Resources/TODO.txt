TODO now:
1. Fix the fucking subtimer so that the sub doesent slowly get later and later ffs
	- This could either be done by calculating the accruracy loss or by making the time more accurate
2. Fix subs always in the center of the screen, prob posX = PosX - (string.length * posSize); or something like that
3. Make shortcuts actually working.
4. Fix actually working settings
5. Make it more visually appealing
6. Search for subs in the app and automatic remove the junk, etc: ">", "--" "," .... and so on

Extra: 
	Write the current sub text to a txt file so a discord bot could access it and send to a discord server
