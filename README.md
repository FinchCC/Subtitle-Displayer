# Subtitle Displayer
a open-source subtitle displayer that is made for watching movies on websites that do not support or have subtitles in your language. It simply reads a txt file and displays the subtitle on top of the movie, with a few settings.

#Example:
![bildeavsub (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85927314/213689601-35a340a8-95d4-4575-b112-06f67ed37823.PNG)

#Important
-Most of the settings and features work, but there are som bugs, and the hotkeys are currently disabled. You therefore need to start the subs from the program than alt-tab back to the movie.
